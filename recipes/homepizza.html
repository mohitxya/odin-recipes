    <p id="t">This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.</p>
    <h2 style="display: block; margin-left: 10px;">Ingredients:</h2>
    <div class="section">
    <ul>
        <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110°F)</li>
        <li>3 1/2 to 4 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Toppings of your choice (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, etc.)</li>

        <li><p>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until bubbles form on the surface, about 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>In a large bowl, combine the flour, olive oil, salt, and sugar. Stir in the yeast mixture and knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about 5 to 7 minutes. Cover the dough and let it rest for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.</p></li>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C). Punch down the dough and roll it out on a lightly floured surface to form the pizza crust. Transfer the crust to a greased baking sheet or pizza stone.</p></li>
        <li><p>Spread pizza sauce evenly over the crust, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, and add your favorite toppings.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before slicing and serving.</p></li>
